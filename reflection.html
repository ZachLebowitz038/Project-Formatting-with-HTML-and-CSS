  <main>
<p> This assignment was pretty straightforward overall. I used an assignment where I had to reflect on my performance when giving an interview about the assigned topic of how technology affects one's workplace. 
  The assignment was divided into sections I could use for my headers, and had a section at the end detailing my questions I asked during the interview, which I could use to display an ordered list.
  I also listed some articles that gave background on the topic, although we did not use these for research on this particular assignment. I found a simple stock image that relates to my topic to 
  put in the beginning of the article, but this was not part of my original assignment either, and I just added it to demonstrate my understanding of incorporating these elements. 
  I included both elements of <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> for bolding. This was to communicate to those using screenreaders that the line with strong emphasis was of logistical importance, while 
  the boldening of my name and the year was to be simply stylistic. I included <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> to explain technical terms that are taught in this class of hourglass form, supertalker open-primary, closed-primary, etc.
  For the document's font family I included Arial, then Helvetica and then sans-serif, since fonts without the serif lines on the tips of the letters would be more noticeably different from the default, Time New Roman, 
  used by HTML and I could quickly register if I did something wrong when incorporating my font styles. For the required colors to utilize, I selected from <li>href="https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp">this website</li>
  and found shades of colors I thought would contrast well. Overall, I could follow the directions pretty consistently and if I ever got confused about how something would affect my CSS, I could just watch the videos or look online to remember if, 
  say, it was margins or padding that changed the amount of outside versus inside space.</p>
