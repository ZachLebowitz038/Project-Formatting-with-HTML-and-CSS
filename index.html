<h2> Interview Topic</h2>
<p>
  I planned to discuss <strong>the impact of technological advancements on EE (interviewee)’s work life</strong>. 
  The overarching topic is quite broad, and did not change or become modified during the IV (interview).
</p>

<h2>Adequacy of IV Planning</h2>
<p>When I had initially planned for my IV, the topic of technology in a 
  changing world seemed as though it could apply to a wide array of individuals, 
  yet in ways which would be specific to the given EE depending on their particular 
  line of work. So I only gave a slight pre-IV, to my EE which entailed an overview 
  of the types of questions I would cover, and if they felt comfortable and confident 
  in their ability to answer them. This allowed there to be no intrusive surprises.</p>
<p>
  I did not conduct background research in regards to the EE’s specific line of work, as 
  the questions I had in mind felt adequate and adaptable to many situations in the workforce 
  today. Especially the questions regarding productivity and efficiency in a changing landscape,
  could be quite topical leading into themes of a post COVID-19, remote professional society. 
</p>

    <p>
      To motivate my EE to participate, I mainly asked in the light of a favor given our relationship,
      with an emphasis on how quick I intended it to be. I scheduled the IV mainly for a time 
      that could work for my EE, and waited until they specifically told me they were available
      to begin. This was done out of respect for the EE’s time, considering they were helping
      me this way.
</p>
    <p>
    The organizational sequence, being a bit of an <i>hourglass form</i>, came from my want to diversify 
    the types of questions asked, with both open and closed questions. The question sequence had been 
    organized beginning with a question that established the general topic, and building upon said topic
    with the consecutive questions, gradually connecting to other topics such as education. This way, the
    order of which questions asked would feel a lot more natural as they were given by this plan.
</p>
    
<h2>Use of Question Sequencing and Transitions</h2>
<p>The beginning ethics and purpose statement went smoothly with the EE. They did not have any additional questions before beginning, and could get on the same page in regards to how the IV was about to go. 
My initial approach to the EE at the beginning was a lot more academic and formal. This served to be practically efficient for asking and presenting the intended questions throughout the IV, but I couldn’t help but notice expressing myself more casually, would have made the interactions feel less dry and more personal inherently.
In the future I might improve by simply coming off much more conversational in nature, and not putting pressure upon myself to act overly professional.
</p>

<p>The first couple of questions went pretty straightforwardly. At only one point I needed to repeat a question that the EE did not hear right away. And when I felt as though the EE had been getting sidetracked, I interjected and refocused the IV to go on with the rest of my planned questions. 
Initially my rapport was firmly at level 1. The exchanges were mostly safe and did not really show much deeper emotions or opinionated conjecture with the questions in mind by this time in the interview.
Overall, the opening of the interview felt quite stiff at times, and I did not necessarily make as much of an effort to connect with the EE as I could have. On top of this, the interjections I used did feel a bit awkward and out of place, as I could not find the right pauses when the EE was speaking to flow as naturally as I could have.

<h2>Primary and Probing Questions</h2>
<p> In general, my questions each did their job by analyzing different processes within the concept of technology in a changing workplace, although some could have been worded more openly and efficiently. My EE’s responses had definitely been more free form and autonomous in a way, being somewhat of a <i>supertalker</i> even when the questions
felt a bit closed or bipolar. This could be good in some ways, for this provided a much more thorough IV, yet also made it a bit difficult to circle back to the next questions I had in mind.</p>

<p>One of the best instances of probing was “In what field specifically would you think you would like to study if you were to get a new education?”. This is worded concisely in a way that accounts for most options the EE could have answered the previous primary question, as well as letting the EE expand on what alternate prospects they may have, reflecting an underlying theme of work aspirations and fulfillment. The next best primary question would be “Describe how technology has impacted your work ethic and productivity overall.”. This worked quite well considering the EE had usually been quite thorough with more open responses throughout the IV. So this gave the EE more free range to cover this final subject of productivity, setting the tone for the last question, being the apex of accessibility, which simply asked for any additional comments.
